pass keyword used to avoid errors when empty code is not allowed
for example -
Before
for i in range(90):

error:  File "/home/main.py", line 10
    def gh():
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 7

after

for i in range(90):
  pass
 
execution does not show any error
